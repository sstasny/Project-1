              <p class="card-text">“When I signed up for ALPHAS in advance of my wedding, my goal was to lose weight and inches (which I did!) - but what I did not expect was to gain friends and a true community that genuinely support one another. All of the trainers at ALPHAS are incredibly knowledgeable and truly invested in helping you reach your personal health goals. While some might be hesitant to join a  Personal Training Program, I can attest to the fact that each program and each session is personalized - and with others in the room, there is an added sense of camaraderie that you won't find anywhere else. My wedding has now come and gone, and I have no intention of stopping at ALPHAS anytime soon. I'd recommend it to anyone.”</p>

              <p class="card-text"> "ALPHAS unlocked the mysteries of working out. I learned the importance of working out your core and how it supports all of your other workouts. After adopting a healthier lifestyle, I felt better throughout the day.

                As part of my journey, I made changes to my entire diet. For about 4-6 months, I eliminated carbs, red meat, sugar, and alcohol while training at ALPHAS. 25% of the challenge was fitness and the rest was diet. ALPHAS was always available to provide support and education as it often difficult to find proper health advice.
                
                Over the course of about 7 months, I saw an amazing transformation and lost over 50 pounds and 9% body fat. This was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done."

ALPHAS do not employ your typical trainers… they know how to give you a great, safe and effective workout. They keep me mentally focused and build my confidence while keeping me motivated; this is a true sign of a great trainers….they makes you want to work out and do well. Now my daughter has trouble keeping up with me."</p>

              <p class="card-text">"I have been training with ALPHAS for several years and have gotten amazing results.  When Noam mentioned the online training option, I was very excited.  The workout that was tailor-made for me is challenging yet easy to follow.  The comprehensive video clips and detailed descriptions of each exercise take all of the guess work out of the program.  I would recommend this option for anyone; ranging from someone who has been working out for years to someone relatively new to the gym."</p>
